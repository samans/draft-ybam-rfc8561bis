# Introduction

This document defines a YANG data model for management and control of
the radio link interface(s) and the relationship to packet (typically
Ethernet) and/or Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) interfaces in a
microwave/millimeter wave node.  The ETSI EN 302 217 series defines
the characteristics and requirements of microwave/millimeter wave
equipment and antennas.  Specifically, ETSI EN 302 217-2 {{EN302217-2}}
specifies the essential parameters for systems operating from 1.4 GHz
to 86 GHz.  The data model includes configuration and state data
according to the new Network Management Datastore Architecture
{{?RFC8342}}.

The design of the data model follows the framework for management and
control of microwave and millimeter wave interface parameters defined
in {{?RFC8432}}.  This framework identifies the need and the scope of
the YANG data model, use cases, and requirements that the model needs
to support.  Moreover, it provides a detailed gap analysis to
identify the missing parameters and functionalities of the existing
and established models to support the specified use cases and
requirements, and based on that, it recommends how the gaps should be
filled with the development of the new model.  According to the
conclusion of the gap analysis, the structure of the data model is
based on the structure defined in {{!RFC8561}}, and it
augments {{!RFC8343}} to align with the same structure for management of
the packet interfaces.  More specifically, the model will include
interface layering to manage the capacity provided by a radio link
terminal for the associated Ethernet and TDM interfaces, using the
principles for interface layering described in {{!RFC8343}} as a basis.

The data nodes for management of the interface protection
functionality is broken out into a separate and generic YANG data
module in order to make it also available for other interface types.

The designed YANG data model uses established microwave equipment and
radio standards, such as ETSI EN 302 217-2; the IETF Radio Link Model
{{!RFC8561}}; and the ONF Microwave Model {{ONF-model}}, as
the basis for the definition of the detailed leafs/parameters, and it
proposes new ones to cover identified gaps, which are analyzed in
{{?RFC8432}}.

## Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are used in this document:

Carrier Termination (CT) is an interface for the capacity provided
over the air by a single carrier.  It is typically defined by its
transmitting and receiving frequencies.

Radio Link Terminal (RLT) is an interface providing packet capacity
and/or TDM capacity to the associated Ethernet and/or TDM interfaces
in a node and is used for setting up a transport service over a
microwave/millimeter wave link.

The following acronyms are used in this document:

  ACM Adaptive Coding Modulation

  ATPC Automatic Transmitter Power Control

  BBE Background Block Error

  BER Bit Error Ratio

  BPSK Binary Phase-Shift Keying

  CM Coding Modulation

  CT Carrier Termination

  ES Errored Seconds

  IF Intermediate Frequency

  MIMO Multiple Input Multiple Output

  RF Radio Frequency

  RLT Radio Link Terminal

  QAM Quadrature Amplitude Modulation

## Tree Structure

A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
{{tree}} of this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these
diagrams is defined in {{?RFC8340}}.

## Prefixes in Data Node Names
In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in {{tab-prefix}}.

## Explanation of the Microwave Data Model

The leafs in the Interface Management Module augmented by RLT and CT
are not always applicable.

"/interfaces/interface/enabled" is not applicable for RLT.  Enable
and disable of an interface is done in the constituent CTs.

The packet-related measurements "in-octets", "in-unicast-pkts",
"in-broadcast-pkts", "in-multicast-pkts", "in-discards", "in-errors",
"in-unknown-protos", "out-octets", "out-unicast-pkts", "out-
broadcast-pkts", "out-multicast-pkts", "out-discards", and "out-
errors" are not within the scope of the microwave radio link domain
and therefore are not applicable for RLT and CT.

# Interface Protection YANG Data Model

The data nodes for management of the interface protection
functionality is broken out from the Microwave Radio Link Module into
a separate and generic YANG data model in order to make it also
available for other interface types.

This module imports modules from {{!RFC8343}}, and it references
{{G.808.1}}.

# Microwave Types YANG Data Model

This module defines a collection of common data types using the YANG
data modeling language.  These common types are designed to be
imported by other modules defined in the microwave area.

# Security Considerations

The YANG data models specified in this document define schemas for
data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols
such as NETCONF {{!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{!RFC8040}}.  The lowest NETCONF
layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) {{!RFC6242}}.  The lowest
RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
transport is TLS {{!RFC8446}}.

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}}
provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

There are a number of data nodes defined in these YANG data models
that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is
the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,
edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a
negative effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and
data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

Interfaces of type microwaveRadioLinkTerminal:

~~~~
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/mode,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/carrier-terminations,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/rlp-groups,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/xpic-pairs,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/mimo-groups, and
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/tdm-connections:
~~~~

These data nodes represent the configuration of the radio link
terminal, and they need to match the configuration of the radio link
terminal on the other side of the radio link.  Unauthorized access to
these data nodes could interrupt the ability to forward traffic.

Interfaces of type microwaveCarrierTermination:

~~~~
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/carrier-id,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/tx-enabled,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/tx-frequency,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/rx-frequency,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/duplex-distance,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/channel-separation,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/rtpc/maximum-nominal-power,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/atpc/maximum-nominal-power,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/atpc/atpc-lower-threshold,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/atpc/atpc-upper-threshold,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/single/selected-cm,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/adaptive/selected-min-acm,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/adaptive/selected-max-acm,
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/if-loop, and
      /if:interfaces/if:interface/rf-loop:
~~~~

These data nodes represent the configuration of the carrier
termination, and they need to match the configuration of the carrier
termination on the other side of the carrier.  Unauthorized access to
these data nodes could interrupt the ability to forward traffic.

Radio link protection:

~~~~
      /radio-link-protection-groups/protection-group:
~~~~

This data node represents the configuration of the protection of
carrier terminations.  Unauthorized access to this data node could
interrupt the ability to forward traffic or remove the ability to
perform a necessary protection switch.

XPIC:

~~~~
      /xpic-pairs:
~~~~

This data node represents the XPIC configuration of a pair of
carriers.  Unauthorized access to this data node could interrupt the
ability to forward traffic.

MIMO:

~~~~
      /mimo-groups:
~~~~

This data node represents the MIMO configuration of multiple
carriers.  Unauthorized access to this data node could interrupt the
ability to forward traffic.

Some of the RPC operations in this YANG data model may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control access to these operations.  These are the
operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

Radio link protection:

~~~~
  /radio-link-protection-groups/protection-group/
                                          manual-switch-working,
  /radio-link-protection-groups/protection-group/
                                          manual-switch-protection,
  /radio-link-protection-groups/protection-group/forced-switch,
  /radio-link-protection-groups/protection-group/
                                          lockout-of-protection,
  /radio-link-protection-groups/protection-group/freeze,
  /radio-link-protection-groups/protection-group/exercise, and
  /radio-link-protection-groups/protection-group/clear
~~~~

These data nodes represent actions that might have an impact on the
configuration of the protection of carrier terminations.
Unauthorized access to these data nodes could interrupt the ability
to forward traffic or remove the ability to perform a necessary
protection switch.

The security considerations of {{!RFC8343}} also apply to this document.
