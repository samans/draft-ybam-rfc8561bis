Discussed [Band & Carrier Aggregation Issue #2](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/2) and went over Daniela's proposal:

[BCA.Proposal.for.ccamp.v02.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17834000/BCA.Proposal.for.ccamp.v02.pptx)

Group agreed to move forward with carrier-terminations and remote-carrier-terminations and remove the concept of carrier connector from the model.
The Radio Link Terminal can have carrier-terminations which have to be interfaces with the iftype of ianaift:microwaveCarrierTermination.
The Radio Link Terminal can also have remote-carrier-terminations, which do not have any restrictions on iftype.
The name of the list (remote-carrier-termination) will be discussed since the list can be used to indicate carrier-terminations that are both remote to the Radio Link Terminal and also within the same Radio Link Terminal used for a hierarchical scenario.

Next step is to create example JSON data for each of the scenarios and review.

After that the other attributes of the interface augementation for Radio Link Terminal will be considered.
