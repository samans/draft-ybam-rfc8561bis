Discussed [Band & Carrier Aggregation Issue #2](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/2) and went over presentations:

Jonas' proposal in [Key Concepts - Bonding BCA v4.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15985835/Key.Concepts.-.Bonding.BCA.v4.pptx)
and
Leo's proposal in [BCA Proposal for ccamp v01.pptx](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/files/15074732/BCA.Proposal.for.ccamp.v01.pptx)

Each proposal defines something new.  In the Jonas proposal a new element called a h-RLT is defined.  In Leo's/et.al. proposal there is a new element called a carrier connector.  The discussion focused on understanding the differences related to supporting both local and remote carrier terminations.

Three questions were identified and are listed in this slide:
