Attendees: Scott, Danilo, Daniella

Current Status Update:

Schedule:
- IETF 124 is 1-7 November 2025 in Montreal.
- Document deadline is: 20 October.  The rfc8561 draft will expire 6 October, so it is important to update the draft before it expires and that will have the added benefit of the draft being in time for consideration at IETF 124.

There are several open Issues:
- Scott will work on #18, #44, and #37 which are editorial and submit a pull request for review
- Daniella will work on #25 and submit a pull request for review
- Others, please consider #46, #26, and #2
- The remaining issue #30 needs further discussion

Discussion on mailing list:
- Please start posting discussion about the issues and other updates to the mailing list.  Need to show activity to the wider community if we want this draft to be adopted by the working group.
