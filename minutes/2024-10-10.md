Microwave Topology Model RFC9656 has been published
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9656/
Errata to fix the examples (to use the proper format for URIs as described in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis/) have been "verified"
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/inline-errata/rfc9656.html

Group Review of pull request:
- https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/31 and https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/35
  - https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/pull/36

Closed:
- https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/33
  - The hardware model work is in IVY, the discussion should be moved there.
- https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/24 and https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/23
  - Now that RFC9656 is published, move the discussion related to "Duplication of link information in topology model" and "actual-received-level power is absent in topology module" to the CCAMP list.

Discussed
- https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/32
  - "compression", requested yang example to further discussion
- https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/25
  - The https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-netmod-intf-ext-yang/ has exited last call without including #25.  Discussion concluded that the functionality described is common to microwave/radio link, but not common enough to make it into common yang for all interfaces.  So consider where to put #25 in the context of 8561bis.
- https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/28
  - "MW-Link encryption", review #28 to determine if the ietf keystore and crypto yang are sufficient


ToDo
- Update the YANG and submit a pull request for review
  - https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/37 and https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/18 and https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/16 and https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/13


Next call 17 October 2024
