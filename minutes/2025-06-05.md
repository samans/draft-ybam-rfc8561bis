Discussed 
[Passive Inventory](https://github.com/aguoietf/draft-ygb-ivy-passive-network-inventory/issues/10)
Observations:
- The diagrams are not representative of current deployment scenarios.  Suggest redrawing them with current deployment options shown.
- Need to understand what the passive inventory will be used for.  Why is the information needed and how will it be used?
- It was noted that passive components like the antenna have information that would be useful and would come from reliable sources.
   - Like Antenna Type, and Diameter information.
- Information about other passive components like waveguides and other items are not as useful except in a maintenance scenario, and the information about those items will not be reliable.

[Pull Request #47 on radio-signal-id](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/pull/47)
- It was decided to close this pull request without merging the changes, and creating a new pull request with the results from the discussion based on the most current YANG file.

Issues #2, #25, and #46 need to have yang contributed and a pull request initiated.

Issue #30:  Italo will check on a generic scheduling algorithm.
