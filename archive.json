It only adds a new type of interface and leaves the existing parts untouched which means that there will be no issue with backward compatibility. The new interface type is also only used when there is a need to model multi-node configurations, which also would simplify the compatibility with the existing model/implementations. See attached slide pack.\r\nThe example is not making use of the new way of representing mode. So far, the new interface type only includes the relationships to other interfaces. If there is a need to add additional leafs, in additions to those available in the generic interface model, then that could be looked into as a second step\r\n[Key Concepts - Bonding & BCA.pptx](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/files/8906436/Key.Concepts.-.Bonding.BCA.pptx)\r\n.",

This means that XPIC, MIMO, nor protection can be supported for the carriers across the two network elements. HRLT is just a function for aggregating traffic from multiple sources/interfaces, similar to LAG but smarter(?) without the limitations with hashing.\r\nIf there is a need to support XPIC, MIMO and protection across two network elements, then there is a need for a tighter integration where also control information needs to be exchanged and where one network element typically would act as a master and in that role control the functionality in the second network element. My assumption has been that in such a case the master network element would need to model the carriers (CTs) in the other network element as if it was part of the master and thereby from a model point of view already be supported by the current model as is. A possible extension could be if there is a need to indicate that a carrier is located physically in another network element.",

You probably also need some kind of rate signaling from the constituent RLTs/interfaces, but I'm not sure that it should be seen as control signaling.\r\nOnce again, there are different ways in which you can implement a system where you support XPIC, MIMO & protection across multiple nodes. One is to view/implement it as one virtual node (one NE & one management interface) combining the two devices/nodes and another is have two separate NEs, but where one of them are in control over the other (active/stand-by). I think the manner in which this is set up is implementation specific. I.e. if you need to start up the node in a specific mode from the beginning or if you can re-configure it in run-time into a stand-alone node or into operating in combination with other nodes.\r\nAs far as possible, I think we should strive for a standardized model which is independent upon the specific implementations and accept that vendors might need to add vendor specific extensions to cover whatever might be specific for their product.",

The figure below shows these relationships.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13891296/232828247-4dc9ff6c-d446-4b6b-90d6-266e6b284589.png)\r\n\r\nHaving chosen to keep the identityref \\<coding-modulation\\> type for \\<profile-id\\>, \\<available-min-acm\\> and \\<available-max-acm\\> would 'point' respectively to the lowest and highest profile present in \\<acm-profile -list\\>. Choosing the identityref \\<coding-modulation\\> type for \\<profile-id\\> means keeping this type in the model which is not future-proof, but would be a good compromise for backward compatibility (A better defined model would require changing the type of \\<available-min-acm\\> and \\<available-max-acm\\> to leafref).\r\n\r\nIn the /if:interfaces/if:interface augment, which contains the radio link configuration attributes, the \\<selected-min-acm\\> and \\<selected-max-acm\\> (or \\<selected-cm\\>) attributes must 'point ' to an element of the \\<acm-profile-list\\> list.

That relates to framework described in RFC8432.\r\n\r\nThe ieee-dot1q-bridge model can perform bridging between ethernet interfaces only (those with \"type\": \"ianaift:ethernetCsmacd\"). Not Microwave (neither thoses \"type\" are \"ianaift:microwaveCarrierTermination\" nor \"ianaift:microwaveRadioLinkTerminal  \"). That is caused by a `when` cause of the `ieee-dot1q-bridge`.\r\n\r\nThe resulting stack: \"virtual Ethernet\" over the RadioLinkTerminal over the CarrierTermination (see diagram below). I am calling \"virtual Ethernet\" as opposed as real 802.3 interfaces (which really cares about duplex, negotiation, etc...).\r\n\r\nThat introduce 2 challenges:\r\n- The \"virtual Ethernet\" interface implements the `ieee802-ethernet-interface` module, with leaves of `<negotiation-status>`, `<duplex>`, `<speed>` and other physical parameters which are meaningless because that layer is virtual.\r\n- That also adds a new \"virtual Ethernet\" interface in the configuration and data: We need to model the relation netween \"virtual Ethernet\" and RadioLinkTerminal. During the plugtest, it was decided to be \"internal mapping\" on 12th call and each vendors provided the interface <name> and <port-ref> to the script.\r\n\r\n![EthernetMicrowave](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/assets/118449612/1e426439-b033-45bf-8b7d-92eb6f279e3d)\r\n\r\nFew questions I wonder:\r\n- Are we still comfortable with that?\r\n- How can we known which \"virtual Ethernet\" corresponds to a microwaveRadioLinkTerminal?

For example,\r\n   the slot where the Radio Link Terminal (modem) is plugged in could be\r\n   associated with a specific Ethernet port due to the wiring in the\r\n   backplane of the system, or it could be flexible and therefore\r\n   configured via a management system or controller.\u201d_\r\n\r\nSo, RFC8432 framework, indicates 2 alternatives, a fixed one and a flexible / configurable one.\r\n\r\nWhen the relationship between the ethernet interface and the mw RLT interface is based on the Physical Equipment configuration, eg mwaveX ethernet port is a backplane port or an internal connection to the RLT-X port of the Radio Unit or Radio module then this is a fixed hw association.\r\n\r\nI do not think that this Ethernet Interface, that is connected to the RLT interface in this way , is a virtual Ethernet port.  It can be a real Ethernet port (ethernetCsmacd type) with a specific MAC address of its own and all other attributes configured.\r\nIt can be an ethernet interface at forced-mode (autoneg is disabled \u2013 it gets speed as the highest capacity of the traffic flow,  that is intended to be conveyed through radio).\r\nThis ethernet interface can be used either as bridged or as routed port.\r\n\r\nSo at this first alternative way indicated at RFC8432, there is no need of modelling of the relationship between the ethernet port of the RFC8432 interface hierarchy and the RLT interface, but instead a HW fixed association exists. I.e. mwave1 eth port  (let's name it so) is fixed to be connected to rlt1 etc.\r\n\r\nWhat needs some further modelling at RFC8561 to my opinion, is the 2nd alternative indicated at RFC8432, i.e.\r\n\r\n_\u201c\u2026or it could be flexible and therefore\r\n   configured via a management system or controller\u201d_\r\n\r\nThis alternative needs a configurable association in the model, that will indicate which ethernet port should be connected to a specific RLT port.\r\nI assume that this alternative needs some kind of multiplexer in the system that can change connections between internal ethernet ports and rlt ports of the Radio Units / Radio Modules of the system.\r\nFurthermore, there may be cases of separate Base Units systems in the network with Ethernet ports and  separate Radio Units systems with RLT ports, used to connect them to their corresponding Base Unit systems and these connections are the ones that are managed by a manager or a controller, indicated at RFC8432.\r\nI have not a practical view of this alternative but I assume that we may need then to configure RLTs and Ethernet ports in a non-fixed way and this configuration / association may be missed currently from RFC8561 yang model.\r\n",

The system can instantiate an virtual ETH interface (type = 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd') and an RLT interface (type = 'ianaift:microwaveRadioLinkTerminal') and provide the association between them using the `higher-layer-if` and `lower-layer-if` leaves, as defined in RFC8343.\r\n\r\nThere is a gap only in the case where the client needs to configure  virtual ETH interface setup over an RLT interface because the `higher-layer-if` and `lower-layer-if` leaves, as defined in RFC8343, are read-only.\r\n\r\nFrom my notes taken during the call with IEEE, I have taken a look at this I-D [draft-ietf-netmod-intf-ext-yang-12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-netmod-intf-ext-yang-12) and noted that the following attribute could be useful to address this gap:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule: ietf-if-extensions\r\n  augment /if:interfaces/if:interface:\r\n    +--rw parent-interface if:interface-ref {sub-interfaces}?\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only concern is that, in the current YANG model, there is a when statement which is not allowing us to use this attribute with 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd' interfaces:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /*\r\n   * Add generic support for sub-interfaces.\r\n   *\r\n   * This should be extended to cover all interface types that are\r\n   * child interfaces of other interfaces.\r\n   */\r\n  augment \"/if:interfaces/if:interface\" {\r\n    when \"derived-from(if:type, 'sub-interface') or\r\n          derived-from-or-self(if:type, 'ianaift:l2vlan') or\r\n          derived-from-or-self(if:type, 'ianaift:atmSubInterface') or\r\n          derived-from-or-self(if:type, 'ianaift:frameRelay')\"  {\r\n      description\r\n        \"Any ianaift:types that explicitly represent sub-interfaces\r\n         or any types that derive from the sub-interface identity.\";\r\n    }\r\n    if-feature \"sub-interfaces\";\r\n\r\n    description\r\n      \"Adds a parent interface field to interfaces that model\r\n       sub-interfaces.\";\r\n    leaf parent-interface {\r\n\r\n      type if:interface-ref;\r\n\r\n      mandatory true;\r\n      description\r\n        \"This is the reference to the parent interface of this\r\n         sub-interface.\";\r\n      reference \"RFC XXXX, Section 2.6 Sub-interface\";\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n However, looking at the comment, it seems worthwhile removing the `when` statement to cover any interface type which can potentially be a child interface of other interfaces:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   * This should be extended to cover all interface types that are\r\n   * child interfaces of other interfaces.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to propose Netmod WG to remove the `when` statement and, if the proposal is accepted, to use this model to resolve this gap\r\n",

The IEEE YANG model defines the `auto-negotiation` as a presence container:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/398d5f579fd281a812226450c44fb1566fc18d3d/standard/ieee/published/802.3/ieee802-ethernet-interface.yang#L146-L149\r\n\r\nThis container must not be present for virtual ETH interfaces setup over an RTL interface.\r\n\r\nThe IEEE 802.3 YANG model also describes the behavior to be implemented if the auto-negotiation is configured for an interface that does not support auto-negotiation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/398d5f579fd281a812226450c44fb1566fc18d3d/standard/ieee/published/802.3/ieee802-ethernet-interface.yang#L188-L189\r\n\r\nThis requirement also applies to virtual ETH interfaces setup over an RTL interface.\r\n\r\nWithin the `capabilities` container, the system must report to the client that auto-negotiation is not supported by the virtual ETH interfaces setup over an RTL interface.\r\n\r\n### Duplex\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that virtual ETH interfaces setup over an RTL interface are always full duplex.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, this attribute can always be set to 'full' and any configuration ignored.\r\n\r\nIMHO, it would be nice to have some other leaf (e.g., within the `capabilities` container) reporting to the client the duplex modes supported by a given ETH interface. We might discuss this with IEEE people since this would be useful also for 802.3 interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Flow Control\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that virtual ETH interfaces setup over an RTL interface do not support any 802.3 flow control mechanism.\r\n\r\nFlow control attributes are defined under a couple of features so it is quite straightforward not to support them if they are not supported by all the Ethernet interfaces (including all the local 802.3 ETH interfaces) on the system.\r\n\r\nIf instead, flow control mechanisms are supported for some local 802.3 ETH interfaces, the features must be supported by the system.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the configuration of the flow control mechanisms can be always disabled and any configuration ignored.\r\n\r\nIMHO, it would be nice to have some other leaf (e.g., within the `capabilities` container) reporting to the client the flow control supported by a given ETH interface. We might discuss this with IEEE people since this would be useful also for 802.3 interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Statistics\r\n\r\nAll the counters are defined as optional RO attributes.

We just need to indicate in some way\r\nthe association of the RLT interface to that Ethernet port.\r\n\r\nThis association / connectivity may not need to consider the RLT i/f\r\nas a Subinterface of a Virtual Ethernet Interface but may need instead\r\nto *extend the ietf-microwave-radio-link.yang to include an\r\nethernet-connection leaf at RLT interface with the interface-ref (name\r\nof the ethernet interface).*\r\nThis association is adequate to my opinion and there is no other need\r\nto be specified because the ethernet connection is managed by\r\nconfiguring the associated ethernet interface, not the rlt interface\r\n(autoneg, speed, duplex etc).\r\nThis additional leaf can be also used in the case of the fixed\r\nhard-wired ethernet connection to return the hard-wired connected\r\nbackplane ethernet port to this rlt interface.\r\n\r\nThe proposal of Italo may be also reasonable, i.e. specifying the rlt\r\ninterface as a subinterface of an etherlike virtual interface but this\r\nhigher-level interface is not actually the peer connected ethernet\r\ninterface to rlt but a higher-level interface, parent of the rlt, that\r\nis connected to the peer interface (eg the backplane port) and we\r\nstill need to provide configuration of this virtual  interface to the\r\npeer backplane ethernet port (that's why Italo correctly studies the\r\nconfiguration attributes of this virtual interface).\r\nIn this way, I think that we still need more things to add for the\r\nstated at RFC8432 flexible configuration of RLT to a specific Ethernet\r\nport (real, not virtual) via the mng system or the controller.\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodoros Kallimanis\r\nPrincipal Engineer (Systems & SW)\r\nDepartment SSD\r\n______________________________________\r\nIntracom Telecom\r\n19.7 km Markopoulou Ave., Peania, GR 19002\r\nBuilding A3, 2nd floor\r\nt:   +30 2106671961\r\nf:   +30 2106671446\r\nm: +30 6941636679\r\n***@***.***\r\nwww.intracom-telecom.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03a4\u03b5\u03c4 17 \u0399\u03b1\u03bd 2024 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 1:38\u202f\u03bc.\u03bc., \u03bf/\u03b7 italobusi ***@***.***>\r\n\u03ad\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c8\u03b5:\r\n\r\n> Most of the leaves of the ianaift:ethernetCsmacd will be irrelevant:\r\n> auto-negotiation, speed, flow-control, ...

This application would need to know the SNR value of the radio links and would act on the transmitted power value, according to a specific control algorithm. To correctly configure transmitted power, the application must know the transmitted power ranges allowed by each ACM profile. The transmitted power ranges are provided by the _max-tx-power_ and _min-tx-power_ parameters\r\n\r\n**Use-case2: Shaping**\r\nSuppose we want to implement an application that reduces the throughput of the routers at the ends of a chain of one or more radio links, in order to avoid packet loss by exploiting the buffering capacity of the router. This application would need to know the current transmitted capacity available on the radio links in order to appropriately configure the router shaper. The current transmitted capacity is a function of the ACM profile that the link is operating at a given moment (which depends on atmospheric events). The current capacity is provided by the _nominal-tx-capacity_ parameter included in the ACM profile list.",

Since [RFC5795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5795) abstract says \"`It is designed to operate efficiently and robustly over various link technologies with different characteristics.`\" and in introduction \"`For many types of networks, reducing the deployment and operational costs by improving the usage of the bandwidth resources is of vital importance.`\": I don't know what are these link technology (RFC just mentions \"wireless\" but doesnot describe it, Several pages later briefly mentions \"PPP\" in parenthesis). **On these link technologies, where do header compression apply: RTL-like or vrtEth?

Therefore, I think that the structure & options for the definition of a profile needs to be more flexible and not restricted to the currently suggested approach.\r\n- My view is that this is a feature that is far from frequently deployed in live networks and if that is true then the question is how much effort we want the industry to invest in this area. More advanced/detailed models -> higher investment?\r\n- And a detail: In addition to enable on/off, operational status could also be useful.",
