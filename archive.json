It only adds a new type of interface and leaves the existing parts untouched which means that there will be no issue with backward compatibility. The new interface type is also only used when there is a need to model multi-node configurations, which also would simplify the compatibility with the existing model/implementations. See attached slide pack.\r\nThe example is not making use of the new way of representing mode. So far, the new interface type only includes the relationships to other interfaces. If there is a need to add additional leafs, in additions to those available in the generic interface model, then that could be looked into as a second step\r\n[Key Concepts - Bonding & BCA.pptx](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/files/8906436/Key.Concepts.-.Bonding.BCA.pptx)\r\n.",

Is this correct (the YANG shifter value is signed)?  Interestingly, the actual-duplex-distance value is unsigned.  \r\n \r\nMy reply:\r\nthe duplex-distance to configure (as an alternative of rx-frequency configuration) is int32 (so signed) to allow to have negative shifter for Rx < TX , but for actual-duplex-instance we report only the positive value.\r\n\r\nAction: validate the understanding of interpretation of duplex-distance\r\n",
